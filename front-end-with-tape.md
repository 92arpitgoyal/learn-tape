# Testing your front end Javascript with Tape

## Why?
Generally it would be nice to only use one testing framework rather than using
separate front end and back end testing frameworks. It means you don't have to flit
between different syntaxes for tests, and that you don't have to bloat your dev
dependencies

## What?
We're going to learn how to use JSDOM alongside tape to test our front end code.

## How?

We're going to have a small example, with some basic DOM manipulation, and we're
going to write some tests for it!

If you haven't already, look through
[the readme of this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape/blob/master/README.md)
 to get introduced to tape.
